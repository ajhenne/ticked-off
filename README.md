# Ticked Off

This gives a few simple commands for managing task entries in Obsidian.

Enjoy the convenience of `obsidian-tasks`, but are ticked off by its mandatory use of emojis (even if selecting dataview mode)? This plugin provides a few simple commands for managing these as a more bare-bones plugin.

- **New task** - provides an easy interface prompting for optional due and scheduled dates, priority and tags fields, with in-built natural language parsing for easily setting dates.
- **Task completion toggling** - a simple command to mark a task as completed, by default this will also append (or remove) a 'completed' date field.


## Installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.


## Example Usage

### New task

### Task completion toggling
